## About
   I am a senior at Oregon State University, finishing up my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Out of high school
   I joined the United States Navy where I was stationed on the USS Pearl Harbor in San Diego, CA. This is where my love 
   for computers came to light, working side by side with Information Technicians (IT's). This part of my life is where I would
   learn some of my most important lessons in becoming part of a team and working toward a common goal.

## Project List

   [Project 1: Two-Factor Authentication  Application](https://github.com/bdholloway/CS370) 
   This application works with GA (Google Authenticator) by generating a QR code which is readable
   by the Android GA application. The URI GA is expecting will be encoded into the QR code. The URI
   contains secret keys along with the user id required for the TOTP algorithm. You can then generate
   an OTP generated by the GA application for a 30 second period and print it to the screen.  


   [Project 2: Gym Website](https://github.com/bdholloway/CS340Project)
   A website that is a fully functional application for a gym with an appealing front-end as well as a functional 
   back-end. It has a fully functional backend that holds login credentials, employee records, and member schedules. 
   A member can login to the website, sign up for training sessions with a particular trainer, and check their 
   current schedule. Trainers can also login, open training blocks for members to sign up for, add/delete 
   training blocks and see their current schedule of training sessions and members that are signed up. The application
   also allows for new member/trainer profile creations. 


   [Project 3: Wastegram Mobile Application](https://github.com/bdholloway/CS492)
   Wastegram is an Android mobile application that was constructed using the Flutter SDK by Google. Its main purpose
   is to record food waste by allowing the user to take a photo, add quantity, mark GPS coordinates, and mark the date
   of the transaction. It is then stored in the Google Cloud Firestore which is utilized as the database. These posts
   are then displayed in a list view on the homepage of the application, organized by date added. These list view items
   are clickable and when selected take the user to the post where its individual information is shown.
